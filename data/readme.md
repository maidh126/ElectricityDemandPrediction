Please review the below real-world data describing electricity demand from mixed-use buildings.

Main challenge - Create a forecast for the 4320 periods marked yellow in the demand column. Tips - Try visualising the data. Describe the features that you see. How can you model them? How can you estimate the accuracy of a forecast?

Please (1) prepare and submit a forecast with values entered in the yellow cells in this file, aiming for an accurate forecast (2) prepare and submit a short document (max 3 A4 sheets or equivalent) describing your approach (3) also submit your workings (whether in spreadsheet form or an analysis script using any tool / language of your choice [e.g. R, Python, Matlab etc]) We will review and discuss your submission in your technical interview.

Note - You should spend at least 1 hour on the exercise and we recommend approx 2 hours including write-up. You may spend longer if you are interested but this is not required, and spending longer will not affect our assessment. We will be reviewing the analytical thinking behind the approach you have taken, and the quality of your communication, rather than the amount of work that has gone in or the absolute accuracy of your forecast.
